# tapoHubitat
TP-Link TAPO device integration for Hubitat Environment.
## Initial Development.  Need user feedback.

### Not currently supported Wifi devices:
	Multi Device Outlets (P135, P300, P400M) .  Will install as newWiFi device.  Need developerData to finish development.
	Smart Cameras.  Not in Support Plan.
 	Robot Vacuum Cleaner.  Not in Support Plan.

### Not currently supported Tapo Hub connected devices:
	a.	Remot Dimmer Switch (S200D).  Will install as newWiFi device.  Need developerData to finish development.
 	b.	Switch (S210, S220).  Will install as newWiFi device.  Need developerData to finish development.
  	c.	TRV Device.  Will install as newWiFi device.  Need developerData to finish development.

### Testing by developer.
The developer did not procure a copy of each device.  Testing was based on Device Type (i.e., color bulh, dimming bulb, plug, switch.  For untested devices, commands were derived from available data on gitHub.  Confidence is high, but not 100%.
